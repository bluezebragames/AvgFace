# Average Undergraduate Face at Caltech

![The magical face](Average.png?raw=true "The magical face")


One day I was thinking about something to do with genetics and anyway this repository is has the average face of my current class of Caltech students (2020).  Apparently a lot of us have black hair.

Calculates average image based off of all of photos on donut.caltech.edu

Possibly to do later: find eyes and tilt image accordingly?
